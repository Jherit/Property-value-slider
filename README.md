# Property value slider (UK)


This is a web UI component that lets a user see how much their estate agent will cost them. Also offsets the agents fee against a fixed-fee (online estate agents now charge a flat fee) to show a saving.

It's basically a HTML form with some JS to do the calculations and format numbers.
User can edit the agents percentage fee and fixed fee.
Inital values are average in the UK (March 2021).
